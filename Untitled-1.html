                <p>
                    Hi I am <strong>Fanie</strong>, A 24 year old Aspiring Agile Web Developer from Mpumalanga South Africa. I started Coding 2018 using C++, but I spent a whole semester not getting it.
                    At 2020 I was coding with C and that was when I suddenly got some interest in Coding since I was enjoying making different functions using my code. At 2021 I was using Java
                    and I first made a few projects with it, which was a basic calculator and a sweep south website locally that takes in the user details straight to the database. For my database
                    I was using mySQL, In April 2021 I heard about CodeX, and well that was when I Knew it was time for a change. I believe so much in unity, this is simply because
                    I know very well that when we are together as individuals we can achieve more and by helping one another that is where we grow individually.
                    I consider myself to be a hard-working, ambitious, diligence and a goal-driven individual who strives under pressure and enjoys new challenges.
                    Last but not least an intellectual person and a very eager to learn person. I will continue to learn till the very end.
                </p>
